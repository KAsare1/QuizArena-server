  "Answer": "C-14 dating works by comparing the present activity of $\\mathrm{C}-14$ in the test sample to the activity of $\\mathrm{C}-14$ in the atmosphere. If the sample comes from a living organism, the activity of C-14 in the sample will be the same as the activity of C-14 atmosphere since the organism will always be taking in C-14 from the atmosphere once it is alive. Therefore C-14 dating will not work in this case since the method depends on the difference between the C-14 activity of the sample and the atmosphere.",

  "Answer": "This is because the velocity of the objects in space is usually very large. This means that the change in kinetic energy can be large during a collision even if the mass of a piece of debris is small, and this may cause significant damage to a space vehicle such as a spacecraft or satellite. Also, the space vehicles are quite delicate and impacts that can punch holes or create deep scratches may cause serious damage.",
